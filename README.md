Utilities for networking in rust with tokio

## WARNIGN

This does not have a well-defined or finished API yet, so breaking changes will be counted as minor changes before release v1.
Documentation is sparse or nonexistant, and things *will* change a lot

## Notice

This is currently under development, and some things may be missing.
It will probably stay this way for a while, as I dont have a lot of time to work on it.
